# my-kube

Manifests for my non-HA Kubernetes sandbox hosted on [Hetzner Cloud][1].

Currently running on a single 1v CPU 2GB ram VM, costing measly 3â‚¬/mo.

Initial setup somewhat based on this great guide on how to set up Kubernetes
cluster on bare metal: [https://github.com/hobby-kube/guide][2].
